This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



In this project I constructed a landing page for AdoptMe.org, a website aimed to find homes for shelter animals. 

The project was created using React.js and styled with SCSS. 

To run the project, clone the repositiory to your machine and run
 ### `npm install` 
 to download all of the required dependencies to run the project. YOU WILL NEED REACT FOR THE PROJECT TO RUN.

After you have successfuly download all of the dependencies, in the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
